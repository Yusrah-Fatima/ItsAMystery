Welcome to this wonderful game created by an absolutely wonderful person
first of all this game is quite random and it is just a mode of venting out stress
after a long day of work.
I know how it feels after that long shift so just relax and
enjoy this little piece of work that thrives on the mind of an 
18 years old first year computer science student lol! (hard r on the 18! I was just baby :o)
Cheers mate :in other words thank you.
DISCLAIMER: I do not actually have anything against
younger sisters (It's cap I do lol). infact I am one. this game is just farce.
If you like it, great! If you don't, then yes you are the problem
JK, Jk NOT heh (Help!! this is very cringe).
